# ScubaGear

ScubaGear is an assessment tool that verifies that a Microsoft 365 (M365) tenantâ€™s configuration conforms to the policies described in the Secure Cloud Business Applications ([SCuBA](https://cisa.gov/scuba)) Security Configuration Baseline [documents](https://cisagov.github.io/ScubaGear/baselines).

> **NOTE**: This documentation can be read using [GitHub Pages](https://cisagov.github.io/ScubaGear).

## Target Audience

ScubaGear is for M365 administrators who want to assess their tenant environments against CISA's Secure Configuration Baselines.

## Overview

ScubaGear uses a three-step process:

TODO:  Does it really spit out JSON?

* **Step One** - PowerShell code queries Microsoft's M365 APIs for various configuration settings.
* **Step Two** - [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) is used to compare these settings against Rego security policies written per  the baseline documents.
* **Step Three** - The results of the comparison are reported as JSON and HTML.

These steps are visualized in an [architecture diagram](docs/images/scuba-architecture.png).

TODO:  THere are a LOT of images in the images folder, but I can't find that anything uses them.  Delete?
